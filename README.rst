GDELT in Python with ``gdeltPyR``
=================================

``gdeltPyR`` is a Python-based framework to access and analyze `Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) 1.0 and 2.0 data <http://gdeltproject.org/data.html>`_ data in Python Pandas or R dataframes (R dataframe output feature coming soon). A user can enter a single date, date range (two strings), or several individual dates and return a `tidy data set ready for scientific or data-driven exploration <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>`_.


`gdeltPyR` retrieves `Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) 1.0 and 2.0 data <http://gdeltproject.org/data.html>`_  via `[parallel HTTP GET requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v0.10.6/user/advanced/#asynchronous-requests>`_ and is an alternative to `accessing GDELT data via Google BigQuery  <http://gdeltproject.org/data.html#googlebigquery>`_. Therefore, the more CPUs or cores you have, the less time it takes to pull more data.  Moreover, the more RAM you have, the more data you can pull.  And finally, for RAM-limited workflows, create a pipeline that pulls data, writes to disc, and flushes.  The only limitation with data pulls ``gdeltPyR`` is you hardware.

The GDELT Project advertises as the largest, most comprehensive, and highest resolution open database of human society ever created. It monitors print, broadcast, and web news media in over 100 languages from across every country in the world to keep continually updated on breaking developments anywhere on the planet. Its historical archives stretch back to January 1, 1979 and accesses the worldâ€™s breaking events and reaction in near-realtime as both the GDELT Event and Global Knowledge Graph update every 15 minutes.  Visit the `GDELT website to learn more about the project <(http://gdeltproject.org/#intro)>`_.

**New Features**
----------------

1.  Added geodataframe output.  This can be easily converted into a shapefile or `choropleth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map>`_ visualization.
2.  Added continuous integration testing for Windows, OSX, and Linux (Ubuntu)
3.  Normalized columns output; export data with SQL ready columns (no special characters, all lowercase)
4.  Choosing between the native-english or translated-to-english datasets from GDELT v2.

Coming Soon (version 0.1.11, as of 29 May 2017)
-----------------------------------------------

* Query Google's BigQuery directly from ``gdeltPyR`` using the `pandas.io.gbq` interface; requires authentication and Google Compute account
* Adding a query for `GDELT Visual Knowledge Graph (VGKG) <http://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-visual-knowledge-graph-vgkg-v1-0-available/>`_
* Adding a query for `GDELT American Television Global Knowledge Graph (TV-GKG) <http://blog.gdeltproject.org/announcing-the-american-television-global-knowledge-graph-tv-gkg/>`_

Installation
------------

Latest release installs from PyPi::

    pip install gdelt

Latest dev version of ``gdeltPyR`` can be installed from GitHub.com::

    pip install git+https://github.com/linwoodc3/gdeltPyR

Contributing to gdelPyR
-----------------------

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

A detailed overview on how to contribute is forthcoming.

Our main requirement (and advice) is to make sure you write a unittest for your enhancement or addition.  Moreover, we can't accept a commit until existing unittests are passing in Travis CI (OSX and Linux) and Appveyor (Windows).

If you are simply looking to start working with the ``gdeltPyR`` codebase, navigate to the `GitHub issues <(https://github.com/linwoodc3/gdeltPyR/issues)>`_ tab and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed where you could start out.

Or maybe through using gdeltPyR you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ``this can be improved``...you can do something about it!


Styles for Submitting Issues/Pull Requests
------------------------------------------
We follow the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/contributing.html#contributing-your-changes-to-pandas>`_  coding style for issues and pull requests.  Use the following style:

* ENH: Enhancement, new functionality
* BUG: Bug fix
* DOC: Additions/updates to documentation
* TST: Additions/updates to tests
* BLD: Updates to the build process/scripts
* PERF: Performance improvement
* CLN: Code cleanup

See `this issue as an example <https://github.com/linwoodc3/gdeltPyR/issues/8>`_.
